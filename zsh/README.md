This is my [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

Files
=====

* `zshrc` is a (hard) link to `~/.zshrc`, the file that is actually read by zsh
  when logging in. It does nothing but load the other files.

* The `completion` directory contains my custom completion functions, for some
  programs that I like but that do not support zsh.

* This file is a README, to have something nicer in the GitHub web display :)
